You cannot be in the Windows Insider program if you're on a local account, requires Microsoft account sign-in

Be careful with driver updater programs. Some programs (IObit Driver Booster) download bad / questionable drivers that can break components (like keyboard and mouse).
   +++ NEVER install drivers that driver updater programs find. use them as reference and look them up, then download yourself if legit

You need to reinstall video drivers, reconfigure video settings, and disable services again after new insider build updates (use bat script)
